<h1>We have created a website that has a database where it stores all the 
the information of the users(Name, last Name , password, email).
two users with the same email can not create a different account , 
the passwords are all encrypted and there is validation for every value that the 
users introduces. The user has one minute to complete all the register process. 
The password must have a length of minimum 8 digits and 
be the same in both cases.  Once the user access the main portal it can be seen 
a welcome message with the userÂ¨s name and an option to log out .
All the images can be save now in the session of the database .
